#### Video Demo:  <URL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfiXuAx8-54>
#### Description:
This is simple todo list that I have made with the help of flask framework in python, sqlite and html, css, js.
In the project a user can sign uo then sign into the site to maintain their todo list. All the tasks are sorted into pending current and upcoming tasks.
The user can then remove tasks once they are done and can add tasks accordingly.
There is also a feature for user to change their password.
